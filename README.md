# Project Description:
Upstream oil and gas development is a major industry and important source of revenue in British Columbia. Drilling and production in the province are located in the northeast corner. This industry is expected to grow significantly in the next two decades, as global demand for natural gas is expected to increase. However, there are concerns that the UOG industry may be having a negative impact on human health in the region. Hence this project will examine whether UOG activity influences air pollutant concentrations in a rural community in northestern British Columbia. We will be looking at time series analysis, followed by building a simple model to see what affects air pollutant concetrations in this region.

This project is submitted as part of CIV1498 - Introduction to Data Science course requirements.
